## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/matracey/PyenvWinWrapper/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/matracey/PyenvWinWrapper/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug_report.md). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the unexpected behavior.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/matracey/PyenvWinWrapper/issues/new?labels=bug&template=feature_request.md) with your suggestion.
- Clearly describe the problem and solution, including why this enhancement would be useful to most `PyenvWinWrapper` users and what the scope of it is.
- Be prepared to discuss, revise, and iterate on your proposal!

### Your First Code Contribution

- Look for open issues on GitHub.
- Comment on the issue expressing your interest in working on it.
- Clone the `PyenvWinWrapper` repository to your computer.
- Create a new branch, make your changes, and then submit a pull request.

### Pull Requests

- The process described here has several goals:
  - Maintain `PyenvWinWrapper`'s quality
  - Fix problems that are important to users
  - Engage the community in working toward the best `PyenvWinWrapper`
  - Enable a sustainable system for `PyenvWinWrapper`'s maintainers to review contributions
- Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
  - After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing
  - If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.
  - The reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
